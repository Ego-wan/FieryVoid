/*Chaff Launcher
intercepts all weapon fire (directed at self) from HEX (including uninterceptable weapons).
Done as: kind of offensive mode - player needs to pick hex to fire at. Animated as kind of EMine. 
All appropriate fire orders will get an interception set up before other intercepts are declared.
If weapon is left to its own devices it will simply provide a single interception (...if game allows non-1-per-turn weapon to be intercepting in the first place!)
